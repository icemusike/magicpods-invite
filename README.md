magicpodsai-prelaunch/
├── index.html          # Main HTML file
├── styles.css          # Stylesheet with responsive design

2. Open `index.html` in a web browser

## Customization

### Colors
The design uses CSS custom properties for easy color customization. Edit the `:root` section in `styles.css`:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #6366f1;    /* Main brand color */
    --secondary-color: #f59e0b;  /* Accent color */
    --text-primary: #1f2937;     /* Main text color */
    /* ... other color variables */
}
```

### Content
- Edit the hero section content in `index.html`
- Update features, testimonials, and other sections as needed
- Replace placeholder links and social media handles

### Email Integration
The current setup shows a demo. To integrate with a real email service:

1. Replace the `handleEmailSubmit` function in `script.js`
2. Add your email service API (Mailchimp, ConvertKit, etc.)
3. Update the form action if using a form service
